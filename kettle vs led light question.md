### If I have a 2000 watt kettle and it takes two minutes to boil water. For how many minutes would that amount of electricity power a 5 watt LED light bulb?

To calculate the amount of time that the 2000 watt kettle could power a 5 watt LED light bulb, we need to use the equation:

Energy (in watt-hours) = Power (in watts) x Time (in hours)

We first need to convert the time that the kettle takes to boil water from minutes to hours:

2 minutes = 2/60 hours = 0.0333 hours

Next, we can calculate the energy used by the kettle to boil water:

Energy (in watt-hours) = 2000 watts x 0.0333 hours = 66.6 watt-hours

Finally, we can calculate the amount of time that the 5 watt LED light bulb could be powered by this amount of energy:

Time (in hours) = Energy (in watt-hours) / Power (in watts)

Time (in hours) = 66.6 watt-hours / 5 watts = 13.32 hours

Therefore, the 2000 watt kettle could power a 5 watt LED light bulb for approximately 13.32 hours.
